&quot;I threw the keys in out of anger&quot; <br>Now THAT killed me 😂
phyllis snorting &amp; dwight opening the door w his butt took me OUT SJSJSHSGSG whyyy was this deleted
Tho half of this actually made the final cut ..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=1m41s"">1:41</a> i love how Dwight exhibits the objects like it was an art gallery lol"
what do you mean so we don&#39;t have to?..these are good
How is Michael more mature in the deleted scenes
Why were these scenes deleted is all I want to know...anyone?
Not Michael calling Pam pervy.. 😭😂
"I love the self awareness @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=4m12s"">4:12</a> 🤣"
"Kevin&#39;s laugh when Ryan getting yelled at xD, hey he did scam the company and shareholders"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=5m05s"">5:05</a> Phyllis doing the Gainax pose"
But i want to see all of them lol
I love David for making Ryan cry . Everyone: But we WANT to watch every deleted scene.
“He just made the list” 🏃🏽‍♂️
I died when he said candy corn and then actually showed it
Toilet tragedy 😭😂😂😂
Believe in Jesus and repent
They really should just release the episodes with all the deleted scenes in them now in an edited way where it works. This stuff is gold.
but we want to see so nah
Those are deleted scenes???? I feel like I&#39;ve watched them in a compilation you guys made of non-deleted scenes.......
&quot;Gluetooth&quot;😂😂
I threw the keys in out of anger! Best deleted scene ever!
Glad they cut the Ryan crying scene. It would of been so out of character for him.
Why is this video so full of ads? Can you even do that?
The fact that you can hear a lot of what David is saying on the phone and he genuinely sounds angry is underrated. Attention to detail always wins.
&quot;my tip calculator&quot; got me
And thus the toilet ideas blossomed
the dwight police tape one is really good!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=2m50s"">2:50</a> toilet guard was mentioned in the golden ticket&#39;s episode."
I don&#39;t think the person who posted this understands how that title works.
"The Office was never the same after Steve Carell left. Comedic genius... who brought it out in everyone there! God, I miss that show!!! Nothing else out there even compares."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a> has me crying 😂😂😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=1m24s"">1:24</a> Jim needs to stop and let Michael finish the story 😒"
it&#39;s really cool
thanks for deleting these scenes🫡
Gluetooth 💀
I CALL BULLSHIT ON THE CALL FROM WALLACE TO RYAN. YOU CANT HEAR ANYTHING THAT WALACE IS SAYING ON THE PHONE IN THE REAL UNCUT EPISODE
“Self cleaning”
I love David for making Ryan cry 😂🙌
But we want to
Hey wtf. Stanley’s not supposed to laugh. Only meatballs.
The blinged out wallet is the best thing
Self cleaning 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=1m30s"">1:30</a> and my glue-tooth fell out of my ear"
Dwight opening the door with his butt
HR said that means your children and grandchildren don&#39;t go to college
this is the best thing ever
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
For the love of all that is good and holy please make an extended cut
You made a youtube video so we dont have to watch it? That title made no sense.
Voglio la decima stagione... Con micheal!
it is weird not knowing all the lines by-heart
"Ryan, being yelled at by David has to be One of the funniest things ever 😂😂"
this little baby goes where you go💀💀
Thank God it was deleted 😂
&quot;That&#39;s what you said last time&quot; gold lol
The only thing I miss and lament in the office is that we never got to see Michael mom e especially Jeff his stepdad
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=2m51s"">2:51</a> everyone&#39;s outfits are different from the scene prior."
🤣❤️
"But I want to watch them all, It&#39;s like second office. Second drink..."
&quot;My Candy corn&quot;
i lost it at the creed scene OMFG ahahahaha
the “everything fell in the toilet” scene should have definitely made it into the show😂
I love when BJ Novak puts himself through these scenes lolol when he writes them
"I liked it how he asked only Phyllis, Stanley and Kevin to try the toilet mesh thingy. Very sus 😂"
Out of great tragedy is the mother of all inventions
"Question, why were these deleted?? Every scene  had me dying 😂😂😂"
I can see why they were deleted.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=6m40s"">6:40</a>"
why WOULDNT you want to watch them?? they bring so much dept to each character!!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a> Kevin’s “But I’m also excited to see the magic” is the most wholesome thing"
that michael GARY scott was genius
Bro how did his wallet and candy corn  fall in????😂😂😂😂 I legit have been laughing at this for 5mins😂😂😂
once the show is over deleted scenes are new episodes.
Awesome
excuse me? So i dont have to? thats all i want to do
Deleted for a reason...
Pam looks really good in that blue shirt
Last two werent cut tho
"I was visiting New York and went to a large magic store and bought one of those thumbs. I put it in my pocket and by the time I got back to the parking garage, it was gone...<br><br>Magic!<br><br>Seriously though, it still amuses me to think what whoever found it must have thought."
"Thanks, I won’t watch them, then."
"When Jim screamed &quot;My god&quot; after Dwight speculated the poison, that was a moment 👏😆😆"
Weird title because I want to watch all the deleted scene
Imagine thinking that there&#39;s only 10 min worth of best of deleted scenes from the office smh
I think it was a good decision to leave those bits on the cutting floor. It is as important to choose well what you put into the show as what you leave out.
Those dang gluetooth things are always falling out of my ear too.
These scenes and all extra content is available on peecock
This feels like one surreal episode where random things happen haha
"Crying shame that these are &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; Imagine the pain for these editors and directors when they have to cut out stuff, and the cut stuff is as amazing as the final episode"
"I cant stop watching these and any office highlights. I first watched the Office during Covid. It definitely saved my life during that terrible period, and all my friends were so jealous that im watching it for the first time"
"You can watch different random scenes of The Office and still be able to have a good belly laugh, and tell everyone&#39;s character on the show. The first clip I ever saw of The Office is actually &quot;Fire drill&quot; clip here on YouTube. I thought I was gonna pass out from laughter 😂😂"
"Why was Dwigt not wearing a newborn baby diarrhea mustard shirt in both scenes around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=2m25s"">2:25</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=2m35s"">2:35</a>?"
all deleted scenes shoud be a last season of &quot;the office&quot; masterpiece
The deadpan comedic acting in the office is really incredible man lmao just the small changes in posture and body movements and facial expressions are what really makes me die laughing....
I threw my keys in out of anger
When Creed says does it have to be clean..... i lost it lmao
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL064KP46UE&amp;t=2m20s"">2:20</a> which episode???????????"
That toilet mesh invention needs to be a real thing. I will find so much amusement out of it.
Ryan kissing his mom 😭
